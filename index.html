      <li>Go to #verification and send a message. If needed, we will ask for further verification that you are someone from Peak to Peak.</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Wait to be verified. This usually takes a couple of minutes, but it could take up to a day for a server moderator to verify you. Please be patient, because we have a small moderation team!</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Once you are verified, you are officially a member of the server! When the call is about to start, join the "Main Room" voice channel, and you will be in the call!</li>
